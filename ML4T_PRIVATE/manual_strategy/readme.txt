Running the code is simple. 

Run the marketsimcode.py to generate in-sample normalized performance plot and portfolio statistics. 

Run the indicators.py code to generate plots of the indicators. 

I havenâ€™t made the start and end dates easily configurable, so you will need to go into the code and uncomment the start/end dates for out-of-sample if you wish to reproduce the out-of-sample plots.
